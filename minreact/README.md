minreact
===

Micro-sugar to allow data classes to be used as React props. Possibly more minor things to be added later.

In a build.gradle.kts, the dependency can be installed with (replace + with the version number you like):

    implementation("com.zegreatrob.testmints:minreact:+")


Examples are [here](https://github.com/robertfmurdock/jsmints/blob/master/minreact/src/jsTest/kotlin/com/zegreatrob/minreact/ReactFunctionTest.kt).
